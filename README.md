# HWR Berlin - Google Calendar Lecture Sync

This tool synchronizes events from the lecture plan of the Hochschule f√ºr Wirtschaft und Recht Berlin (HWR Berlin) to your Google Calendar. It identifies new events and updates your Calendar accordingly. Outdated events are marked as such (not deleted).

## Setup
1. Download/Clone this project repository and navigate to it
2. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python 3.11 or higher if not done already
3. Open a terminal in the project's root folder and install all required Python packages:<br>`pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. With a browser, log into your Google account and create a new,<br>empty Google Calendar; **Remember the calendar title**
5. Google won't yet make this calendar visible on phones. Fix this here: [Google Calendar Sync Settings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/syncselect)
6. Head to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard), create a new project
8. Enable the `Google Calendar API`
9. Generate a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID
10. Download the credentials json file, rename it to `credentials.json` and move it to the project root folder, next to `hwr.py`
11. Open `hwr.py` in a text editor and modify the 'Settings' section:
    - `hwr_ics_link` - Set the URL to link to the ICS file for your lecture plan
        - Go to the HWR Berlin's Lecture Plan
        - Select your course and semester, then right-click copy the link `Stundenplan herunterladen (ICS)`
        - Replace the existing link in the `hwr.py` script with the copied link
    - `google_calendar_name` - Set this to the previously noted title of your Google Calendar
    - `scheduled_seconds` - OPTIONAL: Set the update interval in seconds (default: 28800 = 8 hours)
    - `update_depth` - OPTIONAL: Set the number of events to update into the future (default: 50)

**Note:** On a very first run, you will be asked to grant your API project access to your Google Calendar. This is a one-time process, fully controlled by Google. Google will also inform you that the API project you created is not verified with them. This is normal. The [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python) documentation provides more information on how to set up the API and generate the credentials file.

## Usage
For a full sync, writing everything there is to the calendar, execute: `python hwr.py`<br>
Do this **once, for an initial run**, to populate your calendar with all events.<br>
From there on out, update for a specific number of future events (minimizing API usage and server load) like so: `python hwr.py update`

**Note:** The script runs indefinitely, automatically updating the calendar at given intervals.
